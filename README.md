Final Project by Hartland and Ian

Summary:

This is a program that uses a binary tree to store movie titles, date made, and genre. It can search, print inventory, add movie, delete movie, count movies, and the newest addition finds a list of recomended movies in the same general time period. Although the main structure is a tree, we use arrays to store 5 recomened movies to a node. 


How to run:

First open up the terminal. Once opened, you can name your first file main.cpp while also creating a MovieTree.cpp and MovieTree.h file. Dont forget about including the .txt file into the same folder. Once you have all three files opened, proceed to use the code that we have for you in our program file. Their should be three files matching the titles mentioned above. Once you have the code in the terminal build and run the code, and use it to find movies that you want to watch. If you have any issue leave a comment on this page with a detailed explination of the problem.
